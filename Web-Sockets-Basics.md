# **WebSockets Protocol README**

## **Overview**

The WebSockets protocol is a powerful communication protocol that enables full-duplex communication over TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). It is designed to provide a standardized way for web applications to establish and maintain interactive, real-time communication channels between clients (typically web browsers) and servers.

## **Key Features**

- **Full Duplex Communication**: WebSockets allow simultaneous two-way communication, enabling both the client and server to send and receive data independently over a single connection.
- **Layer 7 Protocol**: WebSockets operate at the Application Layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model, making them highly accessible for web applications. They depend on the Transport Layer (Layer 4) protocol TCP for reliable data transmission.
- **Compatibility with HTTP**: WebSockets are designed to work over standard HTTP ports, such as 443 (HTTPS) and 80 (HTTP). They are also compatible with HTTP proxies and intermediaries, ensuring compatibility with existing web infrastructure.
- **Persistent Connections**: Unlike traditional HTTP requests, WebSockets establish and maintain a persistent connection between the client and server. This persistent connection enables real-time data exchange without the need for repeated request-response cycles.

## **Use Cases**

WebSockets are commonly used in various scenarios, including:

- **Real-Time Chat Applications**: WebSockets enable instant messaging and real-time chat features in web applications.
- **Online Gaming**: Online multiplayer games utilize WebSockets to facilitate real-time gameplay interactions.
- **Collaborative Tools**: Collaborative applications like collaborative document editing and whiteboarding benefit from the real-time communication capabilities of WebSockets.
- **Financial Trading**: Financial platforms use WebSockets to provide up-to-the-millisecond data updates for traders.

## **Ports and URI Schemes**

WebSockets typically use the following ports and URI schemes:

- **Port 443 (wss)**: Secure WebSocket connections are commonly established over port 443. This is the WebSocket Secure (wss) protocol, which uses TLS/SSL encryption to secure data transmission.
- **Port 80 (ws)**: Unsecured WebSocket connections can be established over port 80, although it is less common. This is the WebSocket (ws) protocol, which does not encrypt data in transit.
- **URI Schemes**: WebSockets introduce two new Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes: **`ws`** for WebSocket and **`wss`** for WebSocket Secure. These schemes are used to specify WebSocket connections in URLs.

## **Getting Started**

To implement WebSockets in your web application, you will need to use a WebSocket library or framework compatible with your programming language. These libraries provide APIs for establishing WebSocket connections and handling WebSocket events.
